# Canonical Paths (project-wide)

Project canonical root (use this format in conversation and cross-system notes):

D:/_100W/

Examples:
- Backup zip: D:/_100W/rrxsxyz_next_202510080530_auto-check.zip
- Repo root: D:/_100W/rrxsxyz_next/
- Handover file: D:/_100W/rrxsxyz_next/handover_to_CCR.md

Notes:
- This file records the canonical path format for human-readable logs and inter-team communication.
- Scripts running on Windows still accept backslash paths; this canonical form is for conversational and audit consistency.
